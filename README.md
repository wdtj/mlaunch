# mLaunch launch control system

mLaunch is a mesh network based model rocket launch system designed to handle up to 8 launch pads.  Its primary feature is safety.  Multiple commands are required to enable multiple relays in the launch circuit.  It also provides feedback on igniter resistance and battery voltage.  Using a mesh network, allows near launch pads to relay launch commands to launch pads further away.
